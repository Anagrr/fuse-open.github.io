## Better apps. Less code.

Say hello to UX Markup, the world’s most concise language for creating
rich user experiences.

### Native and snappy

Built with high quality native components and OpenGL-accelerated effects
and transitions.

### Responsive and adaptive

Layout, animation, interaction and live data in beautiful and
easy-to-understand code.

### Declarative and reactive

Do more with less JavaScript. Declarative code is easier to understand,
gives more confidence and less bugs.

### Component-based UI

With UX markup it’s almost hard not to make reusable and modular
components. Everything is composable and all visuals can be re-styled
at any point.

### Make it POP

Motion is a first-class citizen in Fuse - defined entirely in declarative
UX markup. Create animations that respond to changes in state and user
input without any need for JavaScript logic.


## Visual control. Live results.

Fuse is a real-time development environment where the app can be modified
while it is running side by side on multiple platforms. Discover a
unified design and development process.

### Own the UI

The problem no one else has managed to solve — building cross-platform
UIs from one code base that actually looks good? Solved.

### Real-time

Adjust layout, UI, animation and anything else you can imagine, while
the app is running. Revel in accidental discoveries as you build your
app in real-time.

### Fuse Studio

Level up your real-time app development workflow with the world's
first desktop real-time development environment.

## Write once. Write less. {#create-once-wow-everywhere}

Write the client-side business logic of your app in clean and simple
JavaScript, running on a separate thread with no chance to impair UI
performance.

With one shared codebase in UX Markup and JavaScript you can deploy to
both iOS and Android. Access all native features as needed by adding
Objective-C, Swift or Java code directly to your project.

### Minimalist JavaScript

In Fuse, JavaScript is used solely for backend integration and business
logic. This provides a clean separation between view and model, and also
means that UI performance won’t be hampered by JavaScript execution.

### Debugging

You can of course debug the JavaScript logic in your apps with the tools
you already know. Fuse also lets you know of other potential problems with
your code in a dedicated "Problems" panel.

### Obj-C, Swift & Java

With Fuse you have access to all the native features of the underlying
platform. New functionality can easily be integrated by writing code in
the native language once — and then anyone can utilize it from UX Markup
and JavaScript.

## Designed for teamwork.

With Fuse a whole new world of collaboration opens up. Either working
together with another developer in the office or showing off your app to
a client on the other side of the Atlantic: — you're always on the same
page.

### Native platforms

Fuse lets you build complete apps or components that can be dropped into
existing Xcode and Android Studio projects. No need to start from scratch
unless you want to. You can debug, extend and optimize your apps using the
native tools of each platform.

### Powered by code

In Fuse, everything is code and good old fashioned text files you can
manage using your favorite editors and version control tools. Plugins
available for the most popular IDEs and text editors, and [the plugin API is
Open Source](https://fuse-open.github.io/docs/technical-corner/fuse-protocol)
and can be extended by anyone.

### Design tools

Great designs start in great tools. Fuse facilitates a smooth workflow
where design and development is one integrated process. Assets can be
imported and kept in sync with the tools that created them.

## Fuse Professional {#go-pro}

### Next-gen UX

### Extend native apps

Create custom components for use in your existing Xcode and Android Studio
projects. Fuse Professional lets you export native libraries that can be
seamlessly integrated with your native code.

### Charting & visualization
